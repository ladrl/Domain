Domain template
===============

The template is made up from sections. For these sections, there are rules to 
govern their contents.

Sections
--------

 - Name
 
   <What is it called?Â Alternative names, too>
   
 - Context
   
   <What is are the relations to the rest of the world?>
   
   * Assumptions
     <What does this domain assume about the rest of the world?>

 - Purpose
 
   <Why does it exist?>
   
   * Challenge
     <What is the problem to be adressed by the domain?>
   * Solution 
     <How does the domain answer the challange?>
  
 - Glossary
   
   <What are the terms and what do they mean?>
  
 - Semantics
  
   <What are the relations between the terms and how do they construct the value?>
   
   
Rules
-----
Rules for the description of a domain:

 1. All sections are mandatory
 
 2. In the context, no terms of the glossary must be used (when they would be used, they were part of the domain and not the context)
 
 3. In the purpose:
 
  a) only terms referred to in the context may be used to describe the challenge.
  b) terms from the context and the glossary can then be used to describe the solution.
  
 4. The definitions in the glossary must only relate to terms used in the context or in the glossary. The glossary can only define terms which are part of the solution
   ~~> Rule 4 contradicts Rule 2!!
   
 5. The semantics must be described by using only terms from the glossary
 
Rationale for the rules
***********************

 - Rule 1. ensures that the description is complete.
 - Rule 2. enforces the embedding of the domain into the rest of the world. 
 - Rule 3. a. enforces the description of the problem in the terminology of the rest of the world
 - Rule 3. b. enforces the description of the transition from the rest of the world to the domain terminology
 - Rule 4. enforces the definition of the domain in the terms of the description of the world
 - Rule 5. enforces the formulating of the solution using the terms of the domain
