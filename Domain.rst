Domain
======

Name
----

Application domain
 
Context
-------

When faced with the need to split up a problem into composable sub-problems, one needs criteria and concepts
to decide where and how to divide. Each division must adhere to a common understanding
of these criteria and concepts, otherwise these divisions will be inconsistent and hard to understand.
The collection of these criteria and concepts form the base of the division-rationale.

Assumptions
***********

 - a problem can be split into sub-problems which then in turn can be composed to solve the initial problem
 - the criteria and concepts will make each sub-problem distinct from the other sub-problem    

Purpose
-------

Communicate the terminology and the semantics necessary to solve a certain

Problem
-------

Challenge
*********
Clearly identifying and describing concepts and structures necessary to split up a problem into composable sub-problems.
   
Solution
********
Definition of a template with clearly defined sections and rules for the relations
between these sections. The relations are stated as rules about terms and must facilitate the 
description of the evolution of the domain out of its context. The terms introduced by the 
description of the solution of the domain must be defined in a glossary and be set into relation
in a semantics description.
   
Glossary
--------

Template :
  .. todo:: find a good definition, as it is used in the description of the solution
   
Section :
  .. todo:: find a good definition, as it is used in the description of the solution
  
Rule :
  .. todo:: find a good definition, as it is used in the description of the solution

Relation :
  .. todo:: find a good definition, as it is used in the description of the solution

Term :
  A name for a concept or a criteria
  
Domain :
  A name for the concepts an criteria making a sub-problem separate from the other sub-problems
  
Context :
  The description of conceptual environment a domain lives in
  
Glossary :
  A list of definition of terms. The definition creates a new term based on already known terms
  
Semantics :
  A list of rules the terms of the glossary follow. These rules allow reasoning using the glossary to come to conclusions phrasable in terms
  from the glassary.

Semantics
---------

.. todo:: State the consequences of the rules from the `Meta <Meta.rst>`__ document
