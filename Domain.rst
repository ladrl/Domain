Domain

Name
----

Application domain
 
Context
-------

When faced with the need to split up a problem into composable sub-problems, one needs criteria and concepts
to decide where and how to divide. Each division must adhere to a common understanding
of these criteria and concepts, otherwise these divisions will be inconsistent and hard to understand.
The collection of these criteria and concepts form the base of the division-rationale.

Assumptions
***********

 - a problem can be split into sub-problems which then in turn can be composed to solve the initial problem
 - the criteria and concepts will make each sub-problem distinct from the other sub-problem    

Purpose
-------

Communicate the terminology and the semantics necessary to solve a certain

Problem
-------

Challenge
*********
Clearly identifying and describing concepts and structures necessary to split up a problem into composable sub-problems.
   
Solution
********
Definition of a template with clearly defined sections and rules for the relations
between these sections. The relations are stated as rules about terms and must facilitate the 
description of the evolution of the domain out of its context. The terms introduced by the 
description of the solution of the domain must be defined in a glossary and be set into relation
in a semantics description.
